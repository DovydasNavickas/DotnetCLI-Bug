# DotnetCLI-Bug
## This bug took me a week to localize from a big solution (73 projects with quite a few dependencies and interdependencies...).

### No one should ever experience the same frustration for a single dependency to ruin everything in this destructive manner. It works and does not work in the same project with identical code (copy/paste).
